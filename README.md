##Data Preparation

- Converts dates to datetime format
- Creates additional features like ticket month and year
- Extracts device model information

##Failure Prediction Model

1. Approach: I've implemented a survival analysis model using Cox Proportional Hazards
2. Definition of "failure": Based on the data, I've defined failures as issues with image capture, electronics, mechanics, or image quality
3. Features used:

Device age
- Ticket count history
- Device model
- Category information from support tickets



##Multiple Ticket Prediction

1. Approach: Random Forest classification model
2. Features used:

    - Device age
    - Average resolution time
    - Total ticket history
    - Ticket categories (one-hot encoded)


3. Target: Binary prediction of whether a device will have multiple tickets in the next 90 days


##The code will output:

1. A list of devices with their predicted time to failure
2. A list of devices with their probability of having multiple tickets in the next 90 days
3. A CSV file with complete predictions for all devices

##Notes on the Implementation

- The survival analysis approach is particularly well-suited for failure prediction as it handles censored data (devices that haven't failed yet)
- The definition of "failure" can be adjusted based on domain knowledge
- For better accuracy, we could do:

    1. Include more historical data if available
    2. Add additional device characteristics if available
    3. Fine-tune the model hyperparameters
